## Summary
Speech is a modality where both acoustic and verbal 
information can be extracted to recognize human
emotion. However, most speech emotion recognition
(SER) systems use only acoustic features and show
poor performance compared to multimodal emotion
recognition systems. In this research, the use of
acoustic and text features is proposed to improve
the SER performance. Text can be extracted from
speech and it may contributes to emotion recognition. 
For example, an interlocutor can perceive
emotion not only from prosodic information but also
from semantics.
